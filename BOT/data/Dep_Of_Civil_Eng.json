  "description": "Launching the department of Civil Engineering is the latest initiative of HITEC University. It has taken nearly three years of requirement analysis, a deep appraisal of the Civil Engineering programs offered by other institutions, and an evaluation of the unique and distinguishing features that should be the hallmark of our program. The Civil Engineering department of HITEC University enshrines the same attributes that have earned our other programs national and international recognition: top-class faculty, very well-equipped laboratories, and an unstinted commitment to imparting state-of-the-art knowledge. Prospective students are encouraged to choose a university that follows Outcome Based Education (OBE) and meets the Washington Accord criteria for quality teaching and learning. Our Civil Engineering program benefits from a proud five-year legacy. The department has highly qualified and dedicated faculty with diverse intellect, creativity, and talent. It hosts excellent laboratories with the latest equipment in environmentally controlled premises. In addition to its own labs, the department shares facilities with the Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering departments. The curriculum, developed according to the guidelines of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), fully meets the evolving demands of the Civil Engineering discipline. We consider our students our most valued asset and commit to imparting professional knowledge, skills, and a positive attitude so that our graduates become sought-after professionals in both national and international markets. Civil Engineering covers specialties such as structural engineering, transportation systems, fluid mechanics, water resources, geo-systems, and environmental engineering. With recent regional infrastructure projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and national water-scarcity initiatives, the demand for proficient civil engineers has never been higher. The department, established in 2019, currently offers a BS in Civil Engineering that spans four years (eight semesters) and comprises 136 credit hours. It also provides a comprehensive guiding system, counseling, and support to help students identify real-world problems and recommend economically and environmentally viable solutions.",
