  "description": "It is a universally established fact that Mathematics infuses logic, rationality and a systematic process of analysis. These attributes provide the requisite 'spine' to the basic sciences, formulating the foundation of all engineering subjects. The Department of Mathematics at HITEC University was established in 2010 with the aim of providing comprehensive knowledge of Mathematics at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral levels. Undergraduate students in engineering disciplines are provided with knowledge of Applied and Engineering Mathematics. The MS & PhD (Mathematics) programme has earned great repute over the years, and students from across the country show great enthusiasm for admission. Students receive state-of-the-art education and a curriculum designed to produce conceptual and motivated mathematicians of international standard. Various syllabi have been designed to enrich the students’ understanding and to help them successfully encounter practical problems in their careers. In addition to coursework, students are encouraged to carry out research leading to publications in renowned international journals. Highly qualified, research-oriented permanent faculty members (all PhDs except one) have been inducted to meet the challenges at all levels. The department has successfully produced 22 PhDs and more than 200 MSs in a typical span of time. With the launch of the four-year BS (Mathematics) programme in Fall 2019, the department is set to build its own incubation space for research students in the MS & PhD programmes. The programme develops analytical, abstract, and structured thinking and covers a broad range of topics including Pure and Applied Mathematics, Mathematical Modeling, Numerical Analysis, Statistics, and Operational Research. In addition to technical proficiency, there is a strong emphasis on character building so that graduates emerge as good mathematicians, good citizens, and good Muslims. In today’s data-driven world, the role of statistics as part of mathematics is also critically important. The department has established a flagship forum, 'ICAEM', for the mathematics community which provides a platform for discussing emerging ideas and concepts in Applied and Engineering Mathematics. This forum brings together system designers and practicing engineers to review state-of-the-art research findings, and hosts an annual International Conference on Applied and Engineering Mathematics with national and international keynotes.",

      "description": "The MS Mathematics programme requires 24 credit hours of coursework plus an additional 6 credit hours that can be completed either through a research thesis (with successful defense) or by taking two additional courses. This programme imparts specialized knowledge in various areas of Mathematics and exposes students to the latest developments. Special efforts are made to nurture and enhance the research capabilities of students through seminars, workshops, and critique sessions. Typical research topics include Numerical Analysis, Analytical and Numerical techniques for ODEs and PDEs, and Finite Element Analysis. Research opportunities are also available in Numerical Linear Algebra, Fluid Mechanics (Newtonian and Non-Newtonian), Computational Fluid Dynamics, Computational Rheology, and Liquid Chromatography.",

    "PhD Mathematics": {
      "description": "The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Mathematics is the highest degree awarded by the Department. The program comprises 18 credit hours of coursework and 30 credit hours of research thesis. Courses are selected in consultation with the Supervisor and student progress is continuously monitored by the Guidance and Evaluation Committee (GEC). Applicants must possess an MS/MPhil degree with a minimum CGPA of 3.0 out of 4 and must have passed the GAT (Subject) examination as per HEC requirements. After completing the coursework, students must pass a comprehensive examination to be granted candidacy as a PhD scholar. The program requires two years of residency at HITEC University, and the PhD thesis is evaluated by one local and two foreign experts. Upon positive evaluation, the PhD scholar must undertake an open defense. The degree is awarded in recognition of high-level scholarship, independent research ability, and research publications in reputed national and international journals. The department sponsors research activities in areas such as analytic and numerical solutions of ODEs and PDEs, Finite Element Analysis, Numerical Linear Algebra, Newtonian and Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics, and Computational Fluid Dynamics.",
