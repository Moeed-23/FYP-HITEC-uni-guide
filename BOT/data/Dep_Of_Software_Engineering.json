  "description": "Software plays a central and underpinning role in almost all aspects of daily life: communications, government, manufacturing, banking and finance, education, transportation, entertainment, medicine, agriculture, and law. The number, size, and application domains of computer programs have grown dramatically; as a result, huge sums are being spent on software development. Software products help us to be more efficient and productive. They provide information, make us more effective problem solvers, and provide safer, more flexible, and less confining work, entertainment, and recreation environments. Software Engineering is the application of a systematic, disciplined and quantifiable approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of software systems. It is in fact the practice of designing and implementing large, reliable, efficient and economical software by applying the principles and practices of engineering. The department aims to train students in all aspects of the software life cycle from specification through analysis and design to testing, maintenance and evolution of software products.",

    "description": "The Department aims to launch MS Software Engineering from Fall 2021. To fulfill the MS degree requirements, a student must complete 30 credit hours by taking 8 courses (24 credit hours) and 6 credit hours of thesis. The thesis enables students to select a problem, identify research questions, develop a hypothesis, conduct experiments, and present their findings. Alternatively, a non-thesis option is available in which the student takes 10 courses and submits a mandatory technical report. The curriculum is designed according to HEC guidelines, and courses can be selected from the offered list in the semesters.",
